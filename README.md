# Chart My Meds (aka medlist)
An easy to use Angular.js medication list made by a pharmacist coder

The idea was a HIPAA compliant medication list that could be freely shared via a URL with no patient identifiers, but which could still be interoperable with multiple different EHRs.

Built out basic integration with the Allscripts EHR Sandbox. Next steps were to integrate BlueButton+ for VA records.
